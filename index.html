          <h3>Electricity Usage Statistics</h3>
          <p> Today, it's all that and so much more: PCs, charging phones, always-on routers, DVRs, pool filters, security systems and cameras, baby monitors,  smart speakers like Amazon Echo—to name just a few.</p>

          <p>There may not be much you can do about the draw from each item you've got plugged in at home. But you can at least contemplate saving if you measure exactly how much electricity you're using. It's possible to do so for each device—it takes some work to find all the so-called "vampire energy" (aka "vampire load" or "phantom load" or even "leaking electricity") that's being sucked away by devices in a standby mode.</p>

          <p>That's right, even when you think something is turned off, it could still be using power—and in some cases definitely is, if the device is in standby or doing updates or talking to the internet. Finding those can be worth it.  Americans were spending  $19 billion per year on vampire energy as of 2015, according to an NRDC report, and we can safely assume things didn't get better. But how do you even try to put a stake in the heart of vampire energy?</p>

          <h3>Water Usage Statistics</h3>
         <p> The average family can waste 180 gallons per week, or 9,400 gallons of water annually, from household leaks. That's equivalent to the amount of water needed to wash more than 300 loads of laundry.
          Household leaks can waste approximately nearly 900 billion gallons of water annually nationwide. That's equal to the annual household water use of nearly 11 million homes.
          Running the dishwasher only when it's full can eliminate one load of dishes per week and save the average family nearly 320 gallons of water annually.</p>
          </p>Turning off the tap while brushing your teeth can save 8 gallons of water per day and, while shaving, can save 10 gallons of water per shave. Assuming you brush your teeth twice daily and shave 5 times per week, you could save nearly 5,700 gallons per year.
          Letting your faucet run for five minutes while washing dishes can waste 10 gallons of water and uses enough energy to power a 60-watt light bulb for 18 hours.
          Outdoor water use accounts for more than 30 percent of total household water use, on average, but can be as much as 60 percent of total household water use in arid regions.</p>
          <p> Hence digital utility meters are in higher demand to ensure management of bills and conservation of the utilities.</p>

          <h3>Gas Usage Statistics</h3>
           <p>The usage of crude oil as a fuel is increasingly replaced by natural gas, thanks to its non-toxicity and economic viability, which is resulting in a significant growth of the global market for gas meters. The efficiency of gas meters in minimising losses in transmission and distribution has prompted their installation in the supply systems, propelling this market, remarkably.</p>

           <p> According to Transparency Market Research (TMR), the opportunity in the global gas meters market is lucrative and is likely to improve in the near future. In 2017, the market was worth US$2.75 bn, rising at a CAGR of 7.90% during the period from 2017 to 2024, it is likely to reach an impressive value of US$4.72 bn by 2024 end.</p>
            
           <p>The advent and increasing popularity of smart meters, highly efficient in reducing energy consumption in transmission at regular intervals, is projected to support the growth of this market over the next few years. However, the dearth of proper handling and scrutiny of the massive amount of data generated by these meters may act as a hindrance in the market’s growth trajectory in the near future.</p>
