          <p>
            <p>Smart meters measure both electricity and gas usage, letting you monitor your usage in pounds and pence, as well as digitally (and automatically!) sending meter readings to your energy supplier. Energy suppliers can also access your smart meter to change the details of your tariff and switch your meter between different modes, but don’t worry they won’t do this without consulting you first. Smart meters are also important as they are one of the first steps in the digitalisation of the energy industryin our societies.</p>
